Welcome to the project! As you begin coding, here's a guideline for how to name variables effectively, ensuring both readability and maintainability of our code:

**Clarity for General Code:**
- Use names that clearly describe the object or action, such as `stress` or `strain.`
- Use `get_` and `set_` for getters and setters.
- Avoid technical jargon or abbreviations that might not be widely understood.

**Conciseness for Specialized Code:**
- If required, in helper functions dealing with complex physics or mathematics, match your identifiers to the notations used in textbooks like $\sigma$ or $\varepsilon$.

**Consistency:**
- Stick to a consistent naming scheme throughout the project.
- Ensure that similar concepts and variables across different parts of the codebase are named similarly.

**Documentation:**
- Document your naming conventions and their reasoning in the project's coding guidelines.
- Comment your code generously, especially when using less intuitive or specialized names, to explain the rationale.

By following these guidelines, you'll contribute to a codebase that's understandable and accessible to new developers, maintainers, and specialists alike, enhancing collaboration and efficiency in our project. Welcome aboard, and happy coding!
