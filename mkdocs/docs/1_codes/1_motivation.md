### Motivation for the Development and Open Sharing of Codes in Iceberg Calving Research

The development and sharing of computational codes in the context of iceberg-calving research are driven by several key motivations:

- **Enhanced Understanding of Iceberg Calving Dynamics**: The complexity of iceberg calving processes necessitates advanced simulation tools. These codes enable more accurate crevasse propagation and iceberg calving modeling, addressing significant gaps in existing ice dynamics models.

- **Advancement of Computational Tools in Glaciology**: The project's codes integrate novel approaches like poro-damage mechanics and nonlinear viscous ice rheology. This advancement is crucial for understanding the mechanics of ice shelves and glaciers and for predicting their future behavior.

- **Fostering Open Science and Collaborative Research**: Sharing these codes openly aligns with the global scientific community's push towards open science. It promotes collaboration, enhances transparency, and facilitates the inclusion of diverse perspectives in glaciological research.

- **Educational Outreach and Interdisciplinary Learning**: The open availability of these tools serves an educational purpose, enhancing the computational modeling skills of students across disciplines. It aids in bridging the gap between engineering, earth science, and glaciology, fostering a well-rounded understanding of these interconnected fields.

The open dissemination of these specialized codes supports the scientific objective of better understanding and predicting ice sheet dynamics and the educational goal of fostering a new generation of interdisciplinary scientists and engineers. This approach exemplifies the integration of research and education, underpinning the ethos of open science in addressing environmental challenges.
